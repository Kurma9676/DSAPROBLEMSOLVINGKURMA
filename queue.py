# Queue in Python
# Last Updated : 12 Jul, 2025
# Like a stack, the queue is a linear data structure that stores items in a First In First Out (FIFO) manner. With a queue, the least recently added item is removed first. A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.
# Queue in Python
# Operations associated with queue are: 

# Enqueue: Adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition – Time Complexity : O(1)
# Dequeue: Removes an item from the queue. The items are popped in the same order in which they are pushed. If the queue is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition – Time Complexity : O(1)
# Front: Get the front item from queue – Time Complexity : O(1)
# Rear: Get the last item from queue – Time Complexity : O(1)
#implementation of queue in python using 1.list 2.collections.deque 3.queue.Queue
#Using list using append() and pop() instead of enqueue() and dequeue.
#example
queue = []
queue.append('a')
queue.append('b')
queue.append('c')
print("Initial queue")
print(queue)
print("\nElements dequeued from queue")
print(queue.pop(0))
print(queue)
print(queue.pop(0))
print(queue)
print(queue.pop(0))
print("\nQueue after removing elements")
print(queue)
#using collections.dequeue queue in python can be implemented using deque class in collections module
#append and popleft is used
from collections import deque
s=deque()
s.append(1)
s.append(2)
s.append(3)
print(s)
s.popleft()
print("after performing pop operation:",s)
#using Queue class from queue module
# maxsize – Number of items allowed in the queue.
# empty() – Return True if the queue is empty, False otherwise.
# full() – Return True if there are maxsize items in the queue. If the queue was initialized with maxsize=0 (the default), then full() never returns True.
# get() – Remove and return an item from the queue. If queue is empty, wait until an item is available.
# get_nowait() – Return an item if one is immediately available, else raise QueueEmpty.
# put(item) – Put an item into the queue. If the queue is full, wait until a free slot is available before adding the item.
# put_nowait(item) – Put an item into the queue without blocking. If no free slot is immediately available, raise QueueFull.
# qsize() – Return the number of items in the queue.
